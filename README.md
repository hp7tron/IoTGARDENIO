# IoTGARDENIO
	The aim of the Gardenio project is to provide ease of use by using the internet of things technology in a garden where the plant is grown. In this project, the person interested in the garden can grow the plants more easily by displaying the moisture measurement of the soil in the garden, the measurement of the temperature in the environment, the light measurement and the water level measurement through the website. The software and hardware resources to be used for these purposes have been researched and a project plan has been made and the project process has started to be carried out. Related researches and project plan are explained in detail in the introduction and method section. While developing the project, Arduino UNO microcontroller board, light sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, water level sensor, NodeMCU ESP 8266 wifi module, alarm, led lamp, jumper cable, board; Arduino IDE, Jason library, ESP 8266 Wifi library, Firebase, Firebase library, Http Client library, ASP: Net MVC are used in the software.
